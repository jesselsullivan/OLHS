<p>Found a puppy or adult dog you're interested in adopting? Here's information about the Adoption Process and what's included in the Canine Adoption Package.</p>

<p>Need help finding a companion? Please e-mail our adoption counselor at OLHSadoptions@gmail.com to get the conversation started. We work very hard to match a potential adopter with a perfect canine companion.</p>

<p>Interested in a specific breed? We're happy to put you on our wish list and contact you once an animal of that breed is surrendered. Please e-mail Jenn at OLHSdirector@gmail.com with breed, age, and sex preferences.</p>

<p> Effective June 7, 2016, all adoptions must be paid by cash, debit or credit card.  We will no longer accept personal checks.  Thank you!
