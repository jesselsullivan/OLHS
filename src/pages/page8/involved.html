General volunteer opportunities are available to the public Monday through Saturday from 12 – 5 pm. Volunteers may report to the shelter during the times noted above, unless approved for other times by shelter personnel. <b>Any groups with 5 or more volunteers</b> must call and set up a date/time before arriving to ensure an optimal volunteer experience by calling 662.236.7631.</p>

<p>The Oxford-Lafayette Humane Society has a wide range of volunteer opportunities. Opportunities vary upon specific needs and dedication to help the homeless pets of OLHS to thrive in every opportunity possible to help the animals live long and happy lives.  Please read each of the areas for specifics.</p>

<p><b>General Daily Volunteer Opportunities</b> – the day to day operations available for volunteers include, but are not limited to, socializing animals, washing and/or folding laundry, unfolding newspapers, washing dishes, cleaning kennels, sweeping and/or mopping floors or other duties as necessary.</p>

<p><b>Grooming</b> – animals arriving at the OLHS are often in need of grooming.  In many cases to make the animals more comfortable they require in many instances baths to eliminate ticks/fleas, or for longer haired breeds, clipping to remove mats from their coats.  Volunteers are needed to help with these duties to make animals more comfortable, and, in turn, more appealing to potential adopters.</p>

<p><b>Reading with Rover</b> – is a community-based literacy program that takes place at the Oxford-Lafayette County Public Library on the second Saturday of each month, from 10:30-11:30 AM.  At Reading with Rover, children actually read books to a shelter dog, which both improves the reading ability of the child and also provides a much-needed break from shelter life for the dog!  Volunteers are needed to pick up and transport selected animals to and from the Library, ensure proper handling of animal during time of reading, and for younger individuals, encouragement to read along with the volunteer.</p>

<p><b>Adoption Event Coordinator</b> – OLHS is seeking a minimum of two+ dedicated volunteers to coordinate adoption events that are done each month at Hollywood Feed and Petsmart.  Coordinators must become familiar with the OLHS adoption process, be familiar with current OLHS animal’s behavior which are transported to the adoption event, and provide needed information to potential adopter’s at the event.  Event Coordinator’s will need to arrive at the OLHS early to obtain needed information on animals, load, and transport, and set up for the event.  Coordinators will be provided necessary training to ensure a smooth transition to become an Adoption Event Coordinator and all the necessary materials needed to do an adoption event.</p>

<p><b>Hollywood Feed Adoption Event</b> is every month from 11:00 – 3:00 pm on the first Saturday of each month.</p>
 
<p><b>Petsmart Adoption Event</b> is every month from 11:00 – 3:00 pm on the third Saturday of each month.</p>

<p><b>Adoption Event Volunteers</b> – to help make the adoption event successful, additional volunteers are needed to assist the event coordinator throughout the event.  An event typically needs an additional two to three individuals to assist help maintain cleanliness in the area, talk with potential adopters, and assist the Coordinator.</p>

<p><b>Transport Coordinator</b> – OLHS is striving to save more lives by providing transports of animals to areas less populated.  We are seeking a minimum of two+ dedicated volunteers to coordinate transports of these animals.  Coordinators will be responsible for overseeing volunteers to set up necessary crates with appropriate items, identification tags of crates and animals, and ensure loading of the transport van.  Coordinators will be provided necessary training to ensure a smooth transition to become a Transport Coordinator and all necessary information/items needed for the transport.</p>

<p><b>Transport Volunteers</b> – to help make the transport successful, additional volunteers are needed to assist the coordinator and guided by the Transport Coordinator in setting up the necessary crates, tagging/transferring animals to crates, and loading.</p>

<p><b>Transport Drivers</b> - to make all transports successful, a minimum of two individuals are needed to drive on the transport.  Transports typically leave late in the evening to make the drive more comfortable for the animals.  Transport drivers typically drive a minimum of 2 ½ to 3 hours one way to the location and help transfer animals to the receiving Rescue van.  Transport drivers must be at least 21 years old and have a valid driver’s license, insurance, and capable of driving a Sprinter van.  If you are interested in being added to our list of transport drivers, please send your name, telephone number, age, photo of your Driver’s license to olhsdirector@gmail.com .
